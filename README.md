Coding Kata: Roman Numerals - *by Conor Riches*

## Installation
This is an Express app. To run this, you need to follow some steps:
- Install node if you haven't already got it
- Install npm and bower globally
- Clone this repo into a directory of your choice
- run `npm install` - this will install the packages we need for the app
- run `bower install` - this will install the frontend packages we need

## Running the solution
Once you have everything installed you can run the app by typing in the command like in the directory of the solution:
`npm start`

Then, once it's started running, navigate to http://localhost:3000

##Testing the solution
This was built with unit tests using Mocha. To test the app and see how it fares, run:
`npm test`
This will run a custom script that then runs the tests.
